After working for 10 plus years as a baker and chef, I found my passion for coding.
I started with a basic web development course then caught the "bug" of programming.

I spent every free moment learning more about different languages, the history and technical support fundamentals. I quickly developed a love for python and the power of using a program to do complex tasks with just a few lines of code.

For every course I took I went beyond the lecture to research more about every topic on my own. Computer science is a perfect career path for me because its ever changing and no matter how much I learn there is more and its an ever changing field which fits perfectly with my passion for research and learning. Experienced with Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Flask, Docker.

The best part of coding is the problem solving element. I can't even describe the satisfaction I felt when I ran my first program and it worked! I was hooked.

Every program is just a puzzle that can be solved my taking small steps, researching any new elements and putting it all together. I am detail oriented and methodical.
